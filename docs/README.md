# UKMC

## Site description

UKMC Is my pitch for a UKCSC social club for patients legally prescribed CBPMs in the UK.

## Problem

In the UK, there is a lack of venues for trustworthy communication between patients prescribed CBPMs.

## Proposed Solution

The site aims to address this by providing such a venue, and linking together free, hosted services for community use. The site will solve the important verification issue by limiting membership to patients willing to link to an active CanCard both in their name, and with a valid prescription uploaded to it.

## Site  Outline

The site will include integration with it’s own new subreddit, Discord server, and in future, Mastodon instance.

- A subreddit is a privately held forum hosted on and part of https://www.reddit.com

- A Discord server is a privately held discussion server, hosted and operated by https://www.discord.gg

- Mastodon is an open source alternative to twitter, available from https://joinmastodon.org/

The site will feature a welcome page with a guestbook, a news page, an events page, an eligibility page, a guide page, a user registration page, a member’s directory, a contact us page, and a sitemap.

- Welcome page will include a brief introduction to the website, the latest news article, the latest event the guestbook, and links to social media.

- News page will contain news items in the form of blog posts.

- Events page will list past and future events, with a guestbook for future events where members can register their interest. 

- Eligibility page will outline the criteria to qualify for a CBPM prescription, and to be approved as club member.

- Guide page will contain harm reduction and safety information for the use of CBPMs under doctor supervision.

- User Registration page will give users access to a register form that follows a short eligibility survey.

- Contact Us will provide an email contact form and other ways to contact the webmaster.

- Sitemap will contain and index of site links with descriptions.  ## Site functions  To get minimum functionality for this site, the following scripting will need to be implemented.

1. User registration portal, including survey, form, and derestricting guestbooks.

1. Guestbooks

1. Email contact form

1. News article tile generator

1. Event article tile generator

1. Sitemap generator

## Site assets

A logo, branding, and styling will need to be designed, and image assets designed or chosen to form a unifying aesthetic.

-  As a public -facing MC community, stigmatised styling and colours will be avoided.

-  The logo should incorporate elements of the Union Flag.

-  The design will feature elements in flat, rounded colour blocks over a full-width and height photo background.

-  The design will heavily feature bold, sans-serif, italicised lettering.

-  The design and website will not feature photography of prescription medication, or other controversial content.

## Not scheduled for inclusion in minimum viable product:

### Database integration 

The MVP will operate as a demo reliant on local storage.

### Member verification

The MVP will not attempt to verify registered users, or admit them to full club membership.

These functions are expected to remain manual, and would be difficult to simulate using local storage.

### Revenue Generation

The MVP will include space for an advertising banner, and placeholders for tips or donations. Revenue generation will not be appropriate until the site and associated hosted services are operational and in use.

### Active hosted services.

Hosted services will be linked to in an inactive state, for later development after the website has reached a stable form.

## Site Aims

The aim is to create a vibrant, unifying, self-propelling community based on trust between verified patients, that enables them to forge friendships, detail friendly venues, and to plan and attend offline and online events.

Success will be judged by the project’s ability to cover it’s operating costs by the end of year one.
